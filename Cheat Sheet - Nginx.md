# Cheat Sheet - Nginx

By Jack Szwergold, September 27, 2015

Get the version of Nginx from the command line:

    nginx -v

If installed in a non-standard location—like `/opt`—run it like this:

    /opt/nginx/sbin/nginx -v

The output should be something like this:

    nginx version: nginx/1.4.1
